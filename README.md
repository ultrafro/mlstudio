This is a drag and drop playground for learning key concepts from ML

live: https://mlstudio.vercel.app/

## Features:
You can train a model by clicking train-1-step or train continuously

You can set up and design a model by dragging and dropping blocks

Some blocks can be customized, you can change their values / dimensions. You'll get an error if it's the wrong size

You can click on the eye-icon to inspect the values and gradients of a block

## TODO:
This is very much work in progress. Major areas of improvement:
- more blocks (CNN's)
- more custom data definitions / importing
- batch training
- saving models
- inspection of multiple weights / gradients (some blocks can have more than 1 weight)
